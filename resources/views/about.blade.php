    <br>
    <p>Hey all! My name is Wade Wright and I am a native of the Tampa Bay area. I graduated from Riverview High School and went to various schools in the area. I had a short stint at USF and then finished up my schooling at Hillsborough Community College where I obtained my AA in Computer Information Systems.</p>
    <p>I consider myself a self-taught, independant thinking individual. The internet is such a beautiful place for us to achieve anything we desire, there is a tutorial or a video out there that can teach you just about anything.</p>
    <p>I am a huge soccer fan and my favorite team is Manchester City of the English Premier League (which you will notice from the Projects & Games section of the site). I enjoy outdoorsy types of things such as kayaking, hiking, camping, fishing, etc. and I also LOVE to snowboard when given the oppurtunity.</p>
    <p>In March 2017 I decided that it was time for me to join the Software Engineer world. I have spent a decent bit of my professional life on the Technical and Customer Support side of the technology space but have always had a passion for coding. I created this site to show what I have learned in the recent past.</p>
    <p>This site is built on Laravel. I am familiar with PHP, Python, CSS, and HTML. I hope you enjoy!</p>
